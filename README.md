# Pokedex

## Aim
Build a replica of the pokedex, a digital encyclopedia created by Professor Oak as an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pok√©mon world. It gives information about all Pokemon in the world that are contained in its database. 

I aim to build the app in two versions:
- V1:
  - pokedex for generation 1 pokemon
  - replicate the functionality of the pokedex
  - display a list of all 151 pokemon
    - GET pokemon
  - search and display a single pokemon
    - GET pokemon/(name/id)
- V2:
  - same functionality as V1
  - create a visual representation of the pokedex

**Front end**

V1 will include a search box. The searched pokemon will be displayed in a card. The 151 pokemon will be displayed as a scrollable list.

V2 will be a visual replica of the pokedex created using CSS. The search box will be outside of the pokedex, but all information re the pokemon will be contained within the pokedex. 

**Back end**

RESTful Pokemon API <https://pokeapi.co/>

GET requests will be made the to API.
